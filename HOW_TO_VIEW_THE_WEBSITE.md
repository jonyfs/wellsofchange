# 🌐 How to View the Website

## ✅ The Website IS Working!

The development server is running correctly on **http://localhost:5000**

## 📺 How to View in Replit

You might be seeing a **markdown file** instead of the actual website. Here's how to view the web application:

### Option 1: Use the Webview Tab (Recommended)
1. Look at the top of the Replit interface
2. Find the **"Webview"** tab (next to Console/Shell tabs)
3. Click on it to see the actual website

### Option 2: Open in New Tab
1. Click the **"Open in new tab"** button (usually in the top-right corner)
2. The website will open in a full browser tab

### Option 3: Direct URL
Visit: **http://localhost:5000** in your browser

## 🎯 What You Should See

When viewing the correct webview, you'll see:

✅ **Wells of Change** landing page  
✅ Hero section with background image  
✅ Language selector (bottom-right FAB button)  
✅ Donation button (bottom-right FAB button)  
✅ Multiple sections: Our Story, Impact, Projects, Partners  
✅ All content in Portuguese (default) or other languages  

## ❌ What You Might Be Seeing (Wrong)

If you're seeing:
- Plain text or markdown formatting
- File content with # headers
- Documentation text
- No images or styling

**You're looking at a markdown file, not the website!**

## 📂 Note: Documentation Moved

All markdown documentation files have been moved to the `docs/` folder to avoid confusion:

- `docs/README.md` - Overview
- `docs/QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `docs/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` - Deployment instructions
- `docs/DEPLOY_GITHUB_PAGES.pt-BR.md` - Portuguese guide
- And more...

## 🔄 Server Status

The development server should be running. Check the **Console** tab for:
```
serving on port 5000
```

If you don't see this, click the **"Run"** button at the top.

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes Replit needs a refresh
2. **Check the Console tab** - Look for any errors
3. **Restart the workflow** - Click Stop, then Run again
4. **Hard refresh** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

---

**Summary**: The website is working! Just make sure you're looking at the **Webview** tab, not a markdown file. 🎉
